                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    I am an MBA Candidate at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC San Diego and seven years of experience at uLab Systems. I began my career as an engineer and grew into a product leader, building healthcare software that operates in real clinical environments and supports doctors in their daily work.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    At uLab, I led foundational platform initiatives that shaped the company's core systems. My work included migrating a legacy desktop platform to the cloud, integrating 3D scanning hardware into clinical workflows, and aligning engineering, clinical, and commercial teams to ensure the system held up in practice. These projects were not about shipping features. They were about building infrastructure that could scale, adapt, and endure real world constraints.

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    You can explore how I approach these problems in <a href="#work" class="about-link">Professional Work</a>, where I document the decisions, tradeoffs, and outcomes behind the products I have built. When I am not building, you will often find me on a soccer field, in the water chasing waves, behind a camera, or in the kitchen trying something new. These moments of curiosity and exploration shape how I think and create, and they live in <a href="#explorations" class="about-link">Explorations</a>, where I document what I am learning beyond my day to day work.

I have captained teams across different stages of my life, including the UCSD Chinese Soccer Team and Overpower, and won league championships such as the U.S. Southwestern CSSA University Soccer Cup in 2017 and titles in the Bay Area. I still organize matches and training sessions, building teams that grow stronger through consistency and trust.</p>
